Created a beautiful dice roll game where 2 players compete against each other and the first player to reach 100 or more points wins the game.

## Project Overwiew:

1. Designed the layout of the game using CSS GRID layout.
2. Made the game responsive and can be played across any screen(except mobile phone).
3. Used JS DOM to manipulate various properties and styles.
